`<Cub3D>`

This project has been created as part
of the 42 curriculum by `<elerazo->`  `<israetor->`

`<Description:>`

Cub3D is a graphics project inspired by the famous Wolfenstein 3D game.
The goal of this project is to explore the basics of raycasting and understand
how a 3D environment can be rendered from a 2D map using mathematics and geometry.

Through this project, you learn how rays are cast from the player’s point of view,
how walls are detected, and how distances are calculated to create the illusion
of depth. You also work with textures, colors, and basic player movement.

cub3D is an introduction to graphical programming and helps build intuition
about how game engines work at a low level, using the C language.

`<Instructions>`

#Compiling the project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `make` to compile the program.
3. An executable called `cub3D` will be generated.

#Running the program

1. Run the program with a map file:
   `./cub3D maps/map.cub`
2. The map file must follow the rules defined in the subject.
3. The window will open and display the 3D representation of the map.

#Controls

1. Move forward / backward using the keyboard.
2. Rotate the camera left and right.
3. Close the window using the ESC key or the window close button.

`<Submission requirements>`

1. The project must compile without errors or warnings.
2. All mandatory features described in the subject must be implemented.
3. The program must respect the Norm of 42.
4. Memory leaks are not allowed.

#Concepts studied
This project covers the following concepts:

1. Raycasting
2. Basic 3D rendering
3. Trigonometry and geometry
4. Map parsing and validation
5. Textures and colors
6. Event handling
7. Memory management in C

#References

1. 42 cub3D subject documentation
2. Raycasting tutorials
3. Wolfenstein 3D technical articles
4. Peer to peer learning

`<Use of AI >`

AI was used as a learning support tool to:
1. Clarify raycasting and mathematical concepts in simple terms
2. Help understand segmentation faults and memory issues
3. Assist in structuring the project documentation
4. AI was not used to implement the core logic automatically,
   but to better understand the theory and debug errors.

`<This project is part of the learning path at 42 and aims to build a solid foundation
in networking through hands-on practice>`
